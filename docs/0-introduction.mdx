## About this guide 

This guide provides an overview of IXLA's new software platform and integration guidelines for developers that need to work with our printers.

We will start with an [overview][system-overview] of the system where you will learn about: 

* **[IXLA BOX][box]** our modular printers for mid-high volume production applications. 
* **[AIDA (Perso/Machine Controller)][AIDA]** the software platform that controls **IXLA BOX** and all new machines of the **ID** series.
* **[AIDA's WebApp][webapp]**, an example of **software integration** built on top of **AIDA's REST APIs**

We will then setup and run workflows on [IXLA BOX][box] using the [WebApp][webapp], see how the same results can be achived with API calls and, finally, 
how to ***provide personalization data*** to the system and ***schedule jobs*** via [database integration](/docs/setup-and-integration/database-integration)

:::note
Keep in mind that, although we will be using **[IXLA BOX][box]** as an example for integration, the same concepts apply to all supported systems by AIDA

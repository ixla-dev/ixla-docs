## About this guide 

This guide provides an overview of IXLA's new software platform and integration guildines for developers that need to work with our printers.

We will start with an [overview](./system-overview/) of the system where you will learn about: 

* **[IXLA BOX][box]** our modular printers for mid-high volume production applciations. 
* **[IWS (IXLA Web Service)][iws]** the software platform that controls **IXLA BOX** and all new machines of the **ID** series. 
* **[IWS's WebApp][webapp]**, an example of **software integration** built on top of **IWS's REST APIs**

We will then setup and run workflows on [IXLA BOX][box] using the [WebApp][webapp], see how to the same results can be achived with API calls and, finally, 
how to ***provide personalization data*** to the system and ***schedule jobs*** via [database integration](/docs/setup-and-integration/database-integration)

<!-- 

The following concepts will be explained as we encounter them during the integration process: 

* **[SAMLight][samlight]** 
* **[SJF Files][samlight]** 
* **[Entities][samlight]** 
* **[Layouts](./)**
* **[Job Templates](./)**
* **[Data sources](./)**
* **[Data Exchange Tables](./)**
* **[XY Auto-Positioning](./)**
* **[OCR](./)**
* **[Personalization Workflows](./)**
* **[The Workflow Scheduler](./)**
* **[REST APIs & Swagger](./)**

:::note
Keep in mind that, although we will be using **[IXLA BOX][box]** as an example for integration, the same concepts apply to all supported systems by IWS

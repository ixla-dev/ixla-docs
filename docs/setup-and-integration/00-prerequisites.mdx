This is a very quick introduction to SAMLight's job editor the concept of *Entities*, *Pens* and *SJF Files*. 
If you're already familiar with *SCAPS SAMLight* feel free to [skip this section](./configure-job-templates).
:::

Behind the scenes, *IWS* uses *SAMLight*'s *CCI (Client Control Interface)* to handle the engraving process. 
For this reason during system configuration we will be required to upload *SJF (SCAPS Job Format) files*, which 
can be created using *SCAPS SAMLight*. 

## SCAPS SAMLight

**SCAPS SAMLight** is a **WYSIWYG editor** for scanner applications. Users can design and execute laser engraving **Jobs** using a graphical interface. 


import samlight from '../../static/img/scaps/job-editor.png'

<img src={samlight} />

### Entities

Individual elements of the design (text, barcodes, images, shapes) are called **Entities**. 
Each entity is associated with a **Pen**

### Pens

Pen settings (`Mark` tab on the right panel), allow users to setup parameters such as laser power, frequency, scan speed and much more.
Pens can be tweaked to find a balance between performance and printing quaility that matches application's requirements. Ideal parameters selection dependes on many factors and is a topic out of the scope of this guide. 

### Marking 

SAMLight integrates directly with **SCAPS USC-1** board, which controls laser power and drives the scan head during the engraving process. Users can start the marking process from SAMLight's interface. 

### SJF Files

Jobs created with SAMLight can be saved as `.sjf` (SCAPS Job Format) files. IWS manages SJF files and interfaces with SAMLight via CCI interface to handle the engraving process.
